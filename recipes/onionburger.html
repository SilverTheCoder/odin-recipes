    <h2 class="recipe-description title">Description</h2>
    <p class="recipe-description">
        This is a classic oklahoma fried onion burger recipe, which is a bit famous in my family. 
        At its core, this is a simple smash burger with an amazing amount of fried and caramalized onions.
        However, explore the history of the recipe and you will find its orgin in the <strong>Great Depression</strong>, where food outlets
        were saving money by using as much onions as beef in the patties of their burgers.

    <p class="recipe-description"> 
        Simple in design but complex in flavour, you will fall in love with this unassuming smash burger the second you take a bite.
