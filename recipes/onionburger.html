    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a classic oklahoma fried onion burger recipe, which is a bit famous in my family. 
        At its core, this is a simple smash burger with an amazing amount of fried and caramalized onions.
        However, explore the history of the recipe and you will find its orgin in the Great Depression, where food outlets
        were saving money by using as much onions as beef in the patties of their burgers.

    <p> 
        Simple in design but complex in flavour, you will fall in love with this unassuming smash burger the second you take a bite.
