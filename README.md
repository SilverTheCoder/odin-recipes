# odin-recipes

This is a smaller project that will be using pure HTML to create a webpage which will link to recipes.

I should learn more effective VC skills using git, as well as various HTML skills such as:
- Headings, paragraphs
- Use of em and strong
- Putting images in a webpage
- Both absolute and relative paths
